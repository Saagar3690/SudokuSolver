# SudokuSolver

Built using Python Tkinter

Algorithms for solving the board:
- Backtracking (left-to-right and top-to-bottom)
- Reverse backtracking (right-to-left and bottom-to-top)
- Best first search (finds the square with the least possibilites of branching)
- Algorithm X

Algorithm to generate boards of varying difficulty (easy, medium, hard, expert):
1.  Generate a fully solved board
2.  Remove numbers and check if the board is still solvable

# Todo
- Control panel for controlling things like speed, level difficulty, algorithm selection
